```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

def generate_recommendations(data):
    # Perform data preprocessing and feature engineering
    # ...

    # Train a machine learning model
    model = LinearRegression()
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Make predictions
    predictions = model.predict(X_test)

    # Generate recommendations based on predictions
    recommendations = generate_business_recommendations(predictions)

    return recommendations

def generate_business_recommendations(predictions):
    # Implement logic to generate business recommendations based on predictions
    # ...

    return recommendations
```

This code file contains the implementation of the `generate_recommendations` function, which takes in data as input and generates business recommendations based on machine learning predictions. It uses the scikit-learn library to train a linear regression model and make predictions. The `generate_business_recommendations` function can be customized to implement specific logic for generating business recommendations based on the predictions.

Please note that the code provided is a basic template and may require further customization and integration with other components of the AI Startup Suite.
