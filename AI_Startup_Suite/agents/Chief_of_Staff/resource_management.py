        }

```

This code defines the `ResourceManagementAgent` class, which is responsible for providing insights and recommendations on resource allocation and utilization. The `provide_insights` method returns insights on resource allocation and utilization, while the `make_recommendations` method generates recommendations for resource optimization. The actual analysis and recommendation logic can be implemented in the `analyze_resources` and `generate_recommendations` methods, respectively.
