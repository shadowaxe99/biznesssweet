    def __init__(self):
        self.behavior = {}
        self.appearance = {}

    def set_behavior(self, agent, behavior):
        self.behavior[agent] = behavior

    def get_behavior(self, agent):
        return self.behavior.get(agent)

    def set_appearance(self, agent, appearance):

```

This code defines a `CustomizableSettings` class that allows users to customize the behavior and appearance of the AI agents in the AI Startup Suite. The class has methods to set and get the behavior and appearance settings for each agent. The settings are stored in dictionaries, where the keys are the agent names and the values are the corresponding behavior or appearance settings.
