import speech_recognition as sr

def listen():
    r = sr.Recognizer()
    with sr.Microphone() as source:
        print("Listening...")
        audio = r.listen(source)
    
    try:
        print("Recognizing...")
        text = r.recognize_google(audio)
        print("You said:", text)
        return text
    except sr.UnknownValueError:
        print("Sorry, I could not understand.")
    except sr.RequestError as e:
        print("Sorry, there was an error with the speech recognition service:", str(e))

def process_command(command):
    # Add your code here to process the voice command
    pass

def main():
    while True:
        command = listen()
        if command:
            process_command(command)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code defines a `listen` function that uses the `speech_recognition` library to listen to the user's voice input and convert it into text. The `process_command` function is a placeholder for your code to process the voice command and take appropriate actions. The `main` function continuously listens for voice commands and calls the `process_command` function when a command is recognized.
